# General Description
This repository contains games coded in C utilizing the SDL2 Graphics Library. The games are far from perfect and provide only simple examples of different C coding techniques and concepts.
My goal in creating these graphical masterpieces was to further my understanding and increase my comfort in C. It was not my intent to take credit for any of these titles, nor was it to slander the original creators. Anyway, enjoy these pixelated abominations. 

Anyone harmed in the making of these games can contact me...somehow...and explain their complaint directly. I'm sure I can help mitigate the pain I have caused.
